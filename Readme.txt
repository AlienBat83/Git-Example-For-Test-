Hello 

My name is Yousef Samman 
           and i am practicing how to use git for future plan.

# To make the folder that has this file a repository for git 
       we need to use the code  *( git init )*

# To make sure that this step is successfull check if you can 
     find a hidden folder named .git 


# After that you will add the files you want in the repository and 
         commit them in the local repository.

         In this example which is the readme.txt file 


# Now Inorder to connect your local repository to the remote one in 
       github you need to use the link found in github`s repository
        which is in this example this : 
                                       https://github.com/AlienBat83/Git-Example-For-Test-.git
        And you need to use the command 

                  git remote add name_Repo Link  *(The name can be any name )*   

                  Note : You should use the command 
                                    git branch -m main *( To name the branch you are working in main )*

# Now you can push the files in the remote repository by the command 
                       git push linkOrRemote_Name  Branch_name
