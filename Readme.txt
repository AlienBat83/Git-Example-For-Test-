Hello 

My name is Yousef Samman 
           and i am practicing how to use git for future plan.

# To make the folder that has this file a repository for git 
       we need to use the code  *( git init )*

# To make sure that this step is successfull check if you can 
     find a hidden folder named .git 


# After that you will add the files you want in the repository and 
         commit them in the local repository.

         In this example which is the readme.txt file
